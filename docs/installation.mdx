# Installation

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and setting up the Ollama SDK in your JavaScript or TypeScript project.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the SDK, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or later) installed
2. **Ollama** installed and running on your machine or a remote server
   - [Download Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download) if you haven't already

## Installing the SDK

You can install the Ollama SDK using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install @tekimax/ollama-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @tekimax/ollama-sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @tekimax/ollama-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

## Verify Installation

To verify that the SDK has been installed correctly, you can create a simple test script:

```javascript
// test-ollama.js
const { OllamaKit } = require('@tekimax/ollama-sdk');

async function testConnection() {
  const ollama = new OllamaKit();
  
  try {
    const models = await ollama.listModels();
    console.log('Available models:', models.models.map(m => m.name));
    console.log('Ollama SDK is connected successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to connect to Ollama:', error.message);
    console.log('Make sure Ollama is running on your machine');
  }
}

testConnection();
```

Run the script using Node.js:

```bash
node test-ollama.js
```

If Ollama is running and the SDK is installed correctly, you should see a list of available models.

## Installing the CLI (Optional)

The SDK also comes with a command-line interface (CLI) that you can install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @tekimax/ollama-sdk
```

Once installed, you can use the CLI to interact with Ollama directly from your terminal:

```bash
ollama-sdk list
```

This command lists all available models in your Ollama installation.

## Configuration

By default, the SDK connects to Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`. If you're running Ollama on a different host or port, you can configure the SDK:

```javascript
const { OllamaKit } = require('@tekimax/ollama-sdk');

const ollama = new OllamaKit({
  baseUrl: 'http://your-ollama-host:11434' // Replace with your Ollama host
});
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation or connection:

1. **Ollama not running**: Ensure Ollama is installed and running properly
2. **Connection refused**: Check if the Ollama server is accessible at the specified URL
3. **Version compatibility**: Make sure you're using a compatible version of Ollama with this SDK

For more details, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/guides/troubleshooting) or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TEKIMAX/ollama-js-sdk).
